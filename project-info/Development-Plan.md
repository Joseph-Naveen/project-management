## Technology Implementation Strategy

### Backend Development Strategy
1. **Database-First Approach**: Set up complete schema first
2. **API-Driven Development**: Build and test APIs before frontend integration
3. **Security-First**: Implement authentication and authorization early
4. **Modular Architecture**: Separate services for easy maintenance and testing

### Frontend Development Strategy
1. **Component-First**: Build reusable UI components
2. **State Management**: Implement centralized state with Zustand
3. **API Integration**: Use React Query for server state management
4. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic functionality, add complexity

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: 80% coverage for business logic
2. **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
3. **E2E Tests**: Critical user flows
4. **Manual Testing**: UI/UX validation
