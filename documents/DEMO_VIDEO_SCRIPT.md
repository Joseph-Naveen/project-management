## Script Structure

### Introduction (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Application landing page]**

"Welcome to the Project Management Dashboard demo. I'm going to show you a comprehensive project management application built in just 2 days using AI-accelerated development. This application demonstrates how AI tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor can accelerate development while maintaining production-quality code and architecture."

**[Highlight key metrics on screen]**
- "2.5x development acceleration"
- "16 hours total development time"
- "Production-ready Docker deployment"
- "Full TypeScript stack"

### Architecture Overview (45 seconds)
**[Screen: System architecture diagram]**

"The application follows a modern three-tier architecture. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and TypeScript, using PostgreSQL for data persistence. The frontend uses React 18 with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Zustand for state management. Everything is containerized with Docker for consistent deployment."

**[Show docker-compose.yml file]**
"The entire application runs with a single docker-compose command, including PostgreSQL database, backend API, and frontend with nginx reverse proxy."

**[Terminal: docker-compose ps]**
"As you can see, all three services are running and healthy."

### Authentication System (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Login page]**

"Let's start with the authentication system. The application supports role-based access control with four user roles: admin, manager, developer, and QA."

**[Demo login process]**
"I'll log in with the admin account. The authentication uses JWT tokens with refresh token rotation for security."

**[Show successful login and dashboard]**
"After login, users are redirected to the main dashboard with role-appropriate access controls."

### Project Management Features (60 seconds)
**[Screen: Projects list]**

"The core of the application is project management. Users can create, view, and manage projects with comprehensive details."

**[Demo project creation]**
"Let me create a new project. The form includes project details, team member assignment, and milestone planning."

**[Show project creation form being filled]**
"AI generated the entire form validation logic, including real-time validation and user-friendly error messages."

**[Submit project and show in list]**
"The project is immediately visible in the projects list with progress calculation and team member display."

**[Click into project detail]**
"Project detail pages show comprehensive information including tasks, team members, and progress tracking."

### Task Management - Kanban Board (75 seconds)
**[Screen: Task management Kanban board]**

"The task management system features a fully functional Kanban board with drag-and-drop functionality."

**[Demo task creation]**
"Let me create a new task. The task form includes assignment, priority, due dates, and status management."

**[Show task being created]**
"AI generated the entire task management system, including the drag-and-drop logic using react-beautiful-dnd."

**[Demo drag and drop]**
"Tasks can be dragged between columns to update their status. The progress calculations update in real-time."

**[Show task assignment and editing]**
"Tasks can be assigned to team members and edited with double-click functionality."

**[Demo filtering]**
"The board includes filtering by assignee and priority for better organization."

### Collaboration Features (45 seconds)
**[Screen: Task detail with comments]**

"Collaboration is enabled through a comprehensive comment system. Team members can comment on projects and tasks."

**[Demo adding a comment]**
"Comments support real-time updates and user mentions for team communication."

**[Show mention functionality]**
"The mention system provides autocomplete and notification integration."

**[Show activity feed]**
"All activities are tracked in an activity feed for project transparency and audit trails."

### Real-Time Progress Calculations (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Project dashboard showing progress]**

"One of the key improvements was implementing dynamic progress calculations. Previously, progress bars showed static values."

**[Demo completing a task and showing progress update]**
"When I mark this task as complete, watch the project progress update immediately. This uses centralized calculation utilities generated by AI."

**[Show progress calculations in action]**
"The progress calculations are real-time and accurately reflect task completion status across all projects."

### Development Process Highlights (60 seconds)
**[Screen: Code editor showing generated code]**

"Let me show you how AI accelerated the development process. Here's the database schema generated by Cursor AI."

**[Show database models and relationships]**
"Complex relationships and associations were generated automatically with proper TypeScript types."

**[Show API endpoints]**
"GitHub Copilot generated 70% of the API endpoints with proper validation, error handling, and security middleware."

**[Show React components]**
"Frontend components were generated with proper TypeScript interfaces, hooks, and responsive design patterns."

**[Show Docker configuration]**
"Even the deployment configuration was AI-generated, including multi-stage builds and production optimizations."

### Performance and Quality (30 seconds)
**[Screen: Developer tools showing performance metrics]**

"The application maintains production-quality standards. Page load times are under 2 seconds, and the application is fully type-safe with TypeScript."

**[Show network tab with API responses]**
"API responses are optimized with proper caching headers and error handling."

**[Show responsive design]**
"The application is fully responsive and accessible, meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards."

### Docker Deployment Demo (45 seconds)
